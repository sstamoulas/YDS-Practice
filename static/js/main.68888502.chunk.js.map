It mostly eats ants – lots of them, and most parts of an ant`s body are indigestible, which necessitates a huge stomach. Eating more than two hundred ants per day means exposure out in the open for long periods, and having a `heavy` stomach means that a horned lizard finds it difficult to run away from predators. Instead, it relies on an armory of defences. It has camouflage colouring, with an outline broken up by spines and outgrowths, and it will freeze if a predator approaches. Its horns and spines can pierce the throat of a snake or bird, and it can hiss and blow itself up to look even more fearsome. When it comes to coyotes, foxes, and dogs, a horned lizard`s most spectacular defence is to squirt foul-tasting blood from the sinuses behind its eyes. That usually has the desired effect. But it squirts only when it is provoked, since it risks losing up to one quarter of its blood. Such abilities are, however, no defense against human invasion of its land.

This is partly a symptom of their colossal size – adult male great whites can measure in excess of five metres; the temptation for humans to add a metre here or there after reported sightings is irresistable. Sharks are also, by nature, mysterious. Scientists still know next to nothing about great whites’ breeding habits; a birth in the wild has never been observed. One of the biggest great white shark myths is that the creature, disabled by its notoriously poor vision, often mistakes surfers and scuba-divers for its main prey – seals and sea lions. \"Completely false,\" says Richard Aidan Martin, director of the ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research in Vancouver, Canada. After observing 1,000 predatory attacks on sea lions by great whites for five years, he states that the sharks rocket to the surface and crush their prey with incredible force; however, they usually approach humans with leisurely or undramatic behaviour. Martin points out that great whites are curious and investigative animals, which is what most people do not realise. When great whites bite something unfamiliar to them, whether a person or a sea creature, they are looking for tactile evidence about what it is. They usually throw humans out of their mouth after an exploratory bite rather than swallow them for food because humans are too bony. To add more, great whites must be extremely selective about their diet. Their digestive tracts function very slowly, and eating the wrong thing would slow the shark down for days and stop them from consuming anything else.',\n    questions: [\n      {\n        number: 51,\n        answer: 0,\n        question: 'It is understood from the passage that great whites ----.',\n        choices: [\n          'have hardly ever been examined in terms of their breeding habits',\n          'are mysterious because why they mainly prey on seals and sea lions has not been clarified',\n          'are giant creatures whose size can never be measured exactly',\n          'have been studied more extensively than any other creatures in the ocean',\n          'have unusual breeding habits to which scientists have been paying particular attention'\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        number: 52,\n        answer: 3,\n        question: 'It is emphasised in the passage that Richard Aidan Martin ----.',\n        choices: [\n          'monitored great whites mistaking surfers and scuba-divers for seals and sea lions',\n          'focused especially on the disadvantages of great whites’ notoriously poor vision',\n          'examined attacks on sea lions by great whites to prove their aggressive nature',\n          'noted that great whites do not come closer to humans in an actively predatory way',\n          'tried to collect precise information on great whites by observing 1,000 attacks on humans'\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        number: 53,\n        answer: 4,\n        question: 'Which of the following is pointed out in the passage?',\n        choices: [\n          'Great whites confuse humans with seals and sea lions due to their low ability to see.',\n          'Great whites bite humans to explore if their bones are to their taste.',\n          'Great whites are often incapable of choosing the right food for their diet.',\n          'Great whites avoid biting humans and sea creatures that are unfamiliar to them.',\n          'Great whites` diet does not include humans because they have too much bone for them.'\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        number: 54,\n        answer: 1,\n        question: 'Which could be the best title for this passage?

They began recording various folk tales told to them by villagers and farmers near the town of Kassel, Germany, in about 1807. Hansel and Gretel was told to the brothers by a young girl, Doretchen Wild, who years later became Wilhelm Grimm`s wife. The fairy tale gained wide popularity after German composer Engelbert Humperdinck made it the basis of a children`s opera, first introduced in Munich in 1893. However, the opera, as well as subsequent versions of the story, omits the most traumatising aspect of the traditional tale: the parents’ deliberate abandonment of their children to the wild beasts of the forest. Another important feature of Hansel and Gretel is that it was not only known through German oral tradition. A version circulating in France as early as the late 17th century had a house made not of gingerbread but of gold and jewels, in which a young girl is held by a giant whom she eventually pushes into his own fire.
