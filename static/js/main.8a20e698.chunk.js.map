Numerous studies about the effects of games on the brain have come up with conflicting results. A team of scientists gathered all scientific articles to date and compared results. In total they found 116 experiments, the first from the 1980s. Many compared regular video game players with people who had never played. Changes in the brain were measured using techniques which detect whether brain regions increase or reduce in size and how these changes affect the brain’s activity. The study found that the clearest negative impact is the risk of addiction, which could affect other brain functions. Games that heavily rely on online multiplayer modes are the most associated with addiction, due to social interactions being more rewarding than just playing against the computer.

The plan has been in legal limbo for the past year, yet scientists have now calculated another outcome of the policy: harm to crop yields if the plan is stopped. Along with carbon pollution, coal-fired power plants spew pollutants that form smog, which was already known to contribute to increased rates of asthma and premature deaths. The new research estimates the extent to which smog, under air-pollution policies in place before the Clean Power Plan, would limit production in 2020 of four major crops: corn, cotton, potatoes, and soybeans. Led by environmental engineer Shannon Capps, the research team also estimated the extent to which those crop production losses would shrink under three nationwide counter scenarios. One improved the efficiency of individual power plants. Another modelled a policy similar to the Obama plan, setting state carbon dioxide emission goals for the electricity sector. And the third established a tax on carbon emissions, under which emissions decreased the most.

A stomach hormone that stimulates appetite seems to promote the growth of new brain cells and protect them from the effects of ageing ─ and may explain why some people say that fasting makes them feel sharper. Ghrelin is known as the hunger hormone, as it is made by the stomach when it gets empty. If we go a few hours without food, its levels rise in our blood. But there is also evidence that ghrelin can enhance cognition. Animals fed reduced-calorie diets have better mental abilities. Injecting ghrelin into mice improves their performance in learning and memory tests, and seems to boost the number of connections in their brains. Now Jeffrey Davies at Swansea University, UK, and his team have found further evidence that ghrelin can stimulate brain cells to divide and multiply, a process called neurogenesis. When they added the hormone to mouse brain cells grown in a dish, it switched on a gene known to trigger neurogenesis. ‘’If the same happens in animals, this could be how ghrelin affects memory,’’ says Davies, whose work was presented at the British Neuroscience Association conference in 2017.

Still, however quickly and unintentionally these impressions form themselves in us, we are not mindless robots. “People have some flexibility,” says psychologist Melissa Ferguson from Cornell University, who is interested in how people form, and change, their impressions of others. She has a guy named Bob to thank for her findings. For her studies, Ferguson introduces test subjects to a fictional character named Bob. Sometimes Bob is portrayed as good, with a list of a hundred nice behaviours. When subjects find out he is convicted of an immoral act involving a child, the good impression of Bob completely flips.

The route to the New World, the Americas, was at first a secret closely guarded by the Spanish and Portuguese navigators who were exploring the Atlantic – for example, Christopher Columbus, who was working for the Spanish monarchy. Reis surprisingly placed the New World on the correct longitudinal meridian in relation to the African continent. His was the earliest known map to do so. However, similar to other maps of the time, the scale of this map is inconsistent, with the Americas drawn much larger than Africa or Asia. Piri Reis wrote on the map itself that he had consulted other maps in Arabic, including some classical sources. He also referred to four contemporary Portuguese maps, as well as one by Columbus.

It mostly eats ants – lots of them, and most parts of an ant`s body are indigestible, which necessitates a huge stomach. Eating more than two hundred ants per day means exposure out in the open for long periods, and having a `heavy` stomach means that a horned lizard finds it difficult to run away from predators. Instead, it relies on an armory of defences. It has camouflage colouring, with an outline broken up by spines and outgrowths, and it will freeze if a predator approaches. Its horns and spines can pierce the throat of a snake or bird, and it can hiss and blow itself up to look even more fearsome. When it comes to coyotes, foxes, and dogs, a horned lizard`s most spectacular defence is to squirt foul-tasting blood from the sinuses behind its eyes. That usually has the desired effect. But it squirts only when it is provoked, since it risks losing up to one quarter of its blood. Such abilities are, however, no defense against human invasion of its land. Its strange shape and colouring has made it attractive to reptile collectors, and its habit of freezing means that it is prone to being run over.',\n        questions: [\n          {   \n            number: 47,\n            answer: 1,\n            question: 'For a horned lizard, eating too many ants meansthat it ----.',\n            choices: [\n              'has to spend more time to digest what it has eatenthan to hunt for food',\n              'is more vulnerable to predators while trying to runaway',\n              'will become highly indigestible for its predators',\n              'seems to get physically stronger in its struggleto survive in the wild',\n              'causes a huge decrease in the ant population livingaround its habitat'\n            ]\n          },\n          {    \n            number: 48,\n            answer: 0,\n            question: 'How does a horned lizard defend itself when facedwith a predator?',\n            choices: [\n              'It blends into its surroundings using its naturalcolouring and shape.',\n              'It freezes the predator with the help of its spines.',\n              'It makes itself smaller than normal to confuse thepredator.',\n              'It releases a kind of liquid to make the predatorsuffocate.',\n              'It changes its colour and shape to become morethreatening to its predators.'\n            ]\n          },\n          {    \n            number: 49,\n            answer: 0,\n            question: 'It could be bad for a horned lizard to use itsown blood for defence because ----.',\n            choices: [\n              'it might lose a high amount of blood, which would putits life at risk',\n              'predators like the taste of the blood, making themmore willing to eat it',\n              'the bright colour of the blood could make it easyfor predators to see it',\n              'it is an ineffective way of defence when the predator isa snake or bird',\n              'the smell of the blood could attract more predators'\n            ]\n          },\n          {    \n            number: 50,\n            answer: 2,\n            question: 'Upon contact with humans, a horned lizard ----.

This is partly a symptom of their colossal size – adult male great whites can measure in excess of five metres; the temptation for humans to add a metre here or there after reported sightings is irresistable. Sharks are also, by nature, mysterious. Scientists still know next to nothing about great whites’ breeding habits; a birth in the wild has never been observed. One of the biggest great white shark myths is that the creature, disabled by its notoriously poor vision, often mistakes surfers and scuba-divers for its main prey – seals and sea lions. \"Completely false,\" says Richard Aidan Martin, director of the ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research in Vancouver, Canada. After observing 1,000 predatory attacks on sea lions by great whites for five years, he states that the sharks rocket to the surface and crush their prey with incredible force; however, they usually approach humans with leisurely or undramatic behaviour. Martin points out that great whites are curious and investigative animals, which is what most people do not realise. When great whites bite something unfamiliar to them, whether a person or a sea creature, they are looking for tactile evidence about what it is. They usually throw humans out of their mouth after an exploratory bite rather than swallow them for food because humans are too bony. To add more, great whites must be extremely selective about their diet. Their digestive tracts function very slowly, and eating the wrong thing would slow the shark down for days and stop them from consuming anything else.',\n        questions: [\n          {\n            number: 51,\n            answer: 0,\n            question: 'It is understood from the passage that great whites ----.',\n            choices: [\n              'have hardly ever been examined in terms of their breeding habits',\n              'are mysterious because why they mainly prey on seals and sea lions has not been clarified',\n              'are giant creatures whose size can never be measured exactly',\n              'have been studied more extensively than any other creatures in the ocean',\n              'have unusual breeding habits to which scientists have been paying particular attention'\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            number: 52,\n            answer: 3,\n            question: 'It is emphasised in the passage that Richard Aidan Martin ----.',\n            choices: [\n              'monitored great whites mistaking surfers and scuba-divers for seals and sea lions',\n              'focused especially on the disadvantages of great whites’ notoriously poor vision',\n              'examined attacks on sea lions by great whites to prove their aggressive nature',\n              'noted that great whites do not come closer to humans in an actively predatory way',\n              'tried to collect precise information on great whites by observing 1,000 attacks on humans'\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            number: 53,\n            answer: 4,\n            question: 'Which of the following is pointed out in the passage?',\n            choices: [\n              'Great whites confuse humans with seals and sea lions due to their low ability to see.',\n              'Great whites bite humans to explore if their bones are to their taste.',\n              'Great whites are often incapable of choosing the right food for their diet.',\n              'Great whites avoid biting humans and sea creatures that are unfamiliar to them.',\n              'Great whites` diet does not include humans because they have too much bone for them.'\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            number: 54,\n            answer: 1,\n            question: 'Which could be the best title for this passage?

They began recording various folk tales told to them by villagers and farmers near the town of Kassel, Germany, in about 1807. Hansel and Gretel was told to the brothers by a young girl, Doretchen Wild, who years later became Wilhelm Grimm`s wife. The fairy tale gained wide popularity after German composer Engelbert Humperdinck made it the basis of a children`s opera, first introduced in Munich in 1893. However, the opera, as well as subsequent versions of the story, omits the most traumatising aspect of the traditional tale: the parents’ deliberate abandonment of their children to the wild beasts of the forest. Another important feature of Hansel and Gretel is that it was not only known through German oral tradition. A version circulating in France as early as the late 17th century had a house made not of gingerbread but of gold and jewels, in which a young girl is held by a giant whom she eventually pushes into his own fire.

This feat, plus an environmentally conscious approach to innovation, spurred the renowned Swiss adventurer to dream of circumnavigating the globe in a plane that uses no fuel. The result is the Solar Impulse 2, an aircraft equipped with more than 17,000 solar cells. Thanks to lithium batteries that efficiently store energy reserves, it is the first solar-powered plane that can fly through the night. \"If we want to solve our pollution and energy problems,\" says Piccard, a psychiatrist by training, \"we need to increase our energy efficiency and focus on clean technologies.

Search engines cannot access these objects, so their answers are limited to averages and tendencies. To get real answers, we must tap into the chemical make-up of our world. The technology to do this exists, but it is limited to immovable pieces of lab kit called near-infrared (NIR) spectrometers. NIR spectrometers work by shining a spectrum of near-infrared light onto objects and analysing the light that bounces back. Say you want to scan an apple. Each substance within the fruit, be it water, sugar, or fibre, will respond to the light in a unique way. The bonds within them will be energised, moving around at specific wavelengths. The spectrometer can detect these wavelengths and then identify what is inside your particular apple.

The cost of bringing a new compound to the market is now around $2.5 billion, twice as much in real terms as it was a decade ago. One of the costliest parts is recruiting and retaining volunteers to test the drug in a clinical trial. Around three quarters of trials are delayed by problems with this process. Most trials over-recruit by up to 50 percent to compensate, but the drop-out is still so high that only 1 in 20 volunteers end up generating useful data. The result: wasted time, effort and money. That is not for lack of patient willingness. In 2013, the UK`s House of Commons found that people want to volunteer but do not know how. Yet, volunteers can be brought on board and kept there by making more effort to inform and help them to choose which trial they would like to enter.

The fact that he served as a heavily armed soldier in the Peloponnesian War indicates that during the early years of the war, he was roughly middle class, because men from this social class were required to provide their own armour. At some time during this period, Socrates began the mission of moral reform for which he became famous. He passed his time arguing about various moral subjects that interested him with his fellow Athenians and attempting to inspire them to be virtuous and honourable. Socrates` followers included not only Plato, but Alcibiades and Critias as well, both of whom later undermined the Athenian democracy. Possibly because of such notorious connections, Socrates was accused of impiety – showing a lack of respect for God – and corrupting youth. Different versions of the speech he made to defend himself against these accusations still exist today. In his speech, he described himself as a great benefactor to the city, and claimed that the Athenians would harm themselves in killing him.

Aristotle and Theophrastus, who lived in ancient Greece around the 4th century BC, were both involved in identifying and describing plants. Theophrastus has been called the `father of botany` due to his two well-known books on plants that are still influential. The early study of plants, however, was not limited to Western cultures. The Chinese developed the study of botany along lines similar to the ancient Greeks at about the same time. In 60 AD, another Greek, Dioscorides, wrote De Materia Medica, a work that described a thousand medicines, 60 percent of which came from plants. It remained the guidebook on medicines in the Western world for 1,500 years until the compound microscope was invented in the late 16th century.

Hetrick was driving with his wife and daughter in the front seat when he had to change his direction suddenly and brake quickly to avoid an obstacle. Instinctively, he and his wife put their arms out to protect their daughter in case of a crash. This event inspired him to provide automobiles with airbags to protect people during accidents. Hetrick had been an engineer in the US Navy during World War II. He recalled a compressed-air torpedo accidentally turning itself on, causing its canvas cover to shoot up into the air, `quicker than a blink of an eye`. In 1952, Hetrick proposed using compressed air to inflate airbags rapidly during car crashes. He received a patent for this invention in 1953, but car manufacturers in the 1950s were more interested in style than safety. Later, consumers became more safety conscious and airbag technology improved. The first airbags were optional, but by the 1990s, they had become standard. Although airbags have saved thousands of lives, they are not always sufficient to prevent death and injury during crashes. Travellers must also wear seat belts, and automobiles must have dashboards made of soft materials and steering columns that can absorb energy during impact from car crashes.',\n        questions: [\n          {\n            number: 43,\n            answer: 4,\n            question: 'It can be understood from the passage that the airbags were ----.',\n            choices: [\n              'widely accepted when they were first introduced in 1952',\n              'invented with the fundamental aim of making cars look more attractive',\n              'manufactured largely in order to improve automobile marketing and increase the sales',\n              'invented by a US engineer while he was launching the canvas cover into the air',\n              'designed to work very fast to provide immediate protection for people'\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            number: 44,\n            answer: 2,\n            question: 'It is pointed out in the passage that in the 1950s, car manufacturers ----.',\n            choices: [\n              'developed a compressed mechanism which inflated airbags swiftly',\n              'benefitted from optional airbags to raise the safety awareness among the customers',\n              'paid more attention to the physical appearance of cars rather than their safety',\n              'started to produce standard airbags in line with the innovations in airbag technology',\n              'were highly concerned with safety requirements imposed on automobile industry'\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            number: 45,\n            answer: 4,\n            question: 'Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?',\n            choices: [\n              'The injuries and deaths in car accidents can be completely prevented with airbags.',\n              'As soon as Hetrick patented the airbag, it became obligatory for manufacturers to equip cars with airbags.',\n              'The dashboards and steering columns of automobiles should be designed elaborately to increase the efficiency of airbags.',\n              'Travellers are expected to fasten their seat belts which enable the airbags to inflate more quickly.',\n              'Automobile designs are required to manipulate the energy in a crash in order to save people’s lives.'\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            number: 46,\n            answer: 4,\n            question: 'Which could be the best title for the passage?',\n            choices: [\n              'Advances in the Automobile Industry',\n              'An Alternative Way to Save Life',\n              'Airbags as a Safety Regulation',\n              'How to Prevent Car Accidents with Airbags',\n              'The Advance of Airbag Technology'\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        directions: 'Answer these questions according to the passage below.',\n        text: 'An application to translate chimp language may be available in the near future!

Katie Slocombe of the University of York, UK, and her team recorded vocalisations by a group of adult chimps from the Netherlands before and after their relocation to Edinburgh Zoo. Three years after the move, the Dutch chimps has picked up the pronunciation of their Scottish hosts. The peak frequencies of the Dutch chimps` loud calls fell from 932 to 708 hertz to match closely with the low-toned pronunciations of the Scottish apes. The change was gradual and coincided with the growing friendship of the two groups. This means that, like us, chimps can learn foreign language to fit in with new neighbours. The finding also challenges the prevailing theory that chimp words for objects are fixed because they result from excited, involuntary outbursts. The general assumption was that animals do not have control over the sounds they make, whereas we learn the labels for things socially, which is what separates us from animals, states Slocombe.

He is also known as the father of the modern fire extinguisher, which in itself has also saved thousands of lives. Fire extinguishers actually predate Manby`s invention. One of the earliest ones was designed in 1723 by Ambrose Godfrey. Godfrey`s device consisted of a fire-extinguishing liquid and a chamber of gunpowder. When the attached fuses were lit, the gunpowder exploded and scattered the liquid. They were not widely used, although there is an account of them being used in a fire in London in 1729. Manby`s 1818 invention was more efficient. He was inspired to invent a portable fire extinguisher after witnessing firemen`s inability to fight fires on the top floors of buildings because they were difficult to get to. He designed a device containing potassium carbonate with the remaining space taken up by compressed air.

Or at least, it can in mice: a study by Stanford University School of Medicine has discovered that something in the blood of young mice has the ability to restore mental capabilities in older mice. Over the course of three weeks, the scientists gave 18-month-old mice eight infusions of plasma taken from animals that were just three months old, and then put them through a set of experiments to test their spatial memory – memory relating to the position of things and how large or small they are. The mice were seen to perform consistently better in the tests after receiving the young blood. Old mice injected with the blood of other old mice, on the other hand, showed no improvement in the tests. The team found that new connections were also formed in the old mice`s hippocampi, which again were not seen in the control group. The hippocampus is a brain region that plays a huge role in memory, particularly in recognising and recalling spatial patterns. It is very sensitive to ageing, showing a natural decline in function as people grow older.

But neither of them could provide definitive proof of their supposed triumph. Cook`s own evidence was rejected by an independent commission, while Peary refused to hand over any details at all. In 1989, the US National Geographic Society announced that an analysis of photographs taken by Peary, together with his records of ocean depths and other data, were consistent with his expedition getting within eight kilometres of the true pole. Cook`s claim, meanwhile, has always been followed by suspicions of fraud. In the years that followed, the North Pole was reached many times by airborne and submarine expeditions. Surprisingly, the first undisputed expedition to reach the North Pole over the surface did not achieve its goal until 1968, when the American Ralph Plaisted and three companions arrived on snowmobiles.

thought to mark the location of the Buddha`s birth, archaeologists may have discovered the physical roots of the religion: an ancient tree shrine that predates all known Buddhist sites. The archaeological record of Buddhism stretches back to the time of Ashoka, an Indian emperor who enthusiastically embraced the religion in the 3rd century BC and built many temples. The sage known as the Buddha though, probably lived about three centuries earlier. The remains of one of Ashoka`s temples lie at Lumbinini in Nepal, which many recognise as the Buddha`s birthplace. As part of his conservation work, Robert Coningham at Durham University, excavated below the temple foundations. He found evidence of pre-Ashokan stonework and, below that, signs of a timber structure that was radiocarbon dated to between 800 and 550 BC. When the surrounding soil was examined it was found to contain the remains of ancient tree roots, but was strangely free of the debris usually left by human occupation.

At that time, the floods in Czech capital Prague were beginning to recede but Dresden, Germany, was preparing itself for the river Elbe to rise 5 metres higher than normal. \"Several factors are responsible\", says Stéphane Isoard of the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen, Denmark. \"It was spring, so snow was melting from the mountains,\" she says. When two months of rain fell in two days, the water had nowhere to go because the ground was soaked. Climate change also causes heavier rainfall, and might be partly to blame. However, Isoard points out that bad land management is just as important. \"In urban areas, there is less opportunity for water to infiltrate the soil. With more floods inevitable, Europe needs to adapt,\" Isoard says. Some work is already under way. Wetlands are being restored around stretches of the Danube. Green spaces like this can absorb extra water, making floods less severe. \"Over the last 20 years, events like this have become more common,\" says Iain White of the University of Manchester in the UK. \"Central Europe has improved its flood responses since 2002, but there comes a point where you can`t defend,\" he maintains.',\n        questions: [\n          {\n            number: 47,\n            answer: 4,\n            question: 'It is clearly stated in the passage that ----.',\n            choices: [\n              'bad land management is especially responsible for devastating floods as in Passau',\n              'the rise in water levels in central Europe in 1501 was more alarming than that of 2013',\n              'waters from melting snow caused the river Elbe to rise 5 meters, resulting in great harm in Prague and Dresden',\n              'Prague was more vulnerable to harmful consequences of the flood than Dresden',\n              'central Europe should be ready for more severe floods as they seem unavoidable'\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            number: 48,\n            answer: 1,\n            question: 'One of the strategies to cope with floods is to ----.',\n            choices: [\n              'build on areas that are water-resistant',\n              'reconstruct wetlands that can take in more surface water',\n              'decrease the number of urban areas near rivers',\n              'redirect the water that results from melting snow',\n              'establish a system by which neighbouring countries inform each other'\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            number: 49,\n            answer: 3,\n            question: 'One can infer from the passage that in central Europe ----.',\n            choices: [\n              'extreme weather conditions have brought floods, yet there have not been any attempts to cope with them',\n              'the severity of the floods has dramatically decreased since 2002 thanks to the long-term solutions to prevent them',\n              'heavy rainfall will no longer pose a big threat because urban areas have become more prepared for a possible flood',\n              'there have been some precautions taken against the floods, but they are still not totally effective',\n              'climate change has had a more damaging effect than in any other parts of the world'\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            number: 50,\n            answer: 2,\n            question: 'The primary aim of the author is to ----.',\n            choices: [\n              'draw attention to how central Europe has recently been contributing to climate change',\n              'warn governments in central Europe to take immediate action to protect themselves against floods',\n              'give detailed information about the reasons for flooding in central Europe and how to deal with it',\n              'prove the claims made by researchers like Isoard and White about the floods in central Europe',\n              'exemplify the methods to make the soil absorb more water in central Europe'\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        directions: 'soruları aşağıdaki parçaya göre cevaplayınız.',\n        text: 'The influence of technology on diplomacy can be illustrated by leaked and misunderstood telegrams, which shaped the history in unexpected ways.

The Zimmermann telegram was leaked at a time when the American public were still neutral and not ready to join World War I. It prompted the United States to join the Allied forces. The most illustrative case study of the influence of the telegraph on diplomacy was the 1914 July crisis that led to the beginning of the World War I. Telegraph messages were being sent between St. Petersburg, Berlin, Belgrade, Vienna, Paris and other countries involved in the conflict. However, there was little awareness of how to use the telegraph properly.

Fish seems to have made up most of the rest of her diet. If that sounds a little dull, fear not. Meticulous dental analysis reveals she also ate some starchy plant material, most likely to have been seeds, plus mushrooms, although probably in small amounts.
