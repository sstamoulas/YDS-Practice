    text: 'Admired by native peoples for thousands of years, the Texas horned lizard has an array of abilities. It mostly eats ants – lots of them, and most parts of an ant`s body are indigestible, which necessitates a huge stomach. Eating more than two hundred ants per day means exposure out in the open for long periods, and having a `heavy` stomach means that a horned lizard finds it difficult to run away from predators. Instead, it relies on an armory of defences. It has camouflage colouring, with an outline broken up by spines and outgrowths, and it will freeze if a predator approaches. Its horns and spines can pierce the throat of a snake or bird, and it can hiss and blow itself up to look even more fearsome. When it comes to coyotes, foxes, and dogs, a horned lizard`s most spectacular defence is to squirt foul-tasting blood from the sinuses behind its eyes. That usually has the desired effect. But it squirts only when it is provoked, since it risks losing up to one quarter of its blood. Such abilities are, however, no defense against human invasion of its land. Its strange shape and colouring has made it attractive to reptile collectors, and its habit of freezing means that it is prone to being run over.',

    text: ' More mythology surrounds the shark than any other creatures in the ocean. This is partly a symptom of their colossal size – adult male great whites can measure in excess of five metres; the temptation for humans to add a metre here or there after reported sightings is irresistable. Sharks are also, by nature, mysterious. Scientists still know next to nothing about great whites’ breeding habits; a birth in the wild has never been observed. One of the biggest great white shark myths is that the creature, disabled by its notoriously poor vision, often mistakes surfers and scuba-divers for its main prey – seals and sea lions. "Completely false," says Richard Aidan Martin, director of the ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research in Vancouver, Canada. After observing 1,000 predatory attacks on sea lions by great whites for five years, he states that the sharks rocket to the surface and crush their prey with incredible force; however, they usually approach humans with leisurely or undramatic behaviour. Martin points out that great whites are curious and investigative animals, which is what most people do not realise. When great whites bite something unfamiliar to them, whether a person or a sea creature, they are looking for tactile evidence about what it is. They usually throw humans out of their mouth after an exploratory bite rather than swallow them for food because humans are too bony. To add more, great whites must be extremely selective about their diet. Their digestive tracts function very slowly, and eating the wrong thing would slow the shark down for days and stop them from consuming anything else.',

    text: 'The story of Hansel and Gretel, in which two children outsmart a witch who is about to destroy them, was passed down to us from the brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm. They began recording various folk tales told to them by villagers and farmers near the town of Kassel, Germany, in about 1807. Hansel and Gretel was told to the brothers by a young girl, Doretchen Wild, who years later became Wilhelm Grimm`s wife. The fairy tale gained wide popularity after German composer Engelbert Humperdinck made it the basis of a children`s opera, first introduced in Munich in 1893. However, the opera, as well as subsequent versions of the story, omits the most traumatising aspect of the traditional tale: the parents’ deliberate abandonment of their children to the wild beasts of the forest. Another important feature of Hansel and Gretel is that it was not only known through German oral tradition. A version circulating in France as early as the late 17th century had a house made not of gingerbread but of gold and jewels, in which a young girl is held by a giant whom she eventually pushes into his own fire. However, it was the Grimm brothers who immortalised the tale for future generations – an excellent story that every child throughout the world should come across.',

    text: 'In Bertrand Piccard`s family, there is a tradition of being first. His grandfather, Auguste, was the first person to ride a balloon into the stratosphere. His father, Jacques, was the first to reach the Earth`s deepest point, the Pacific`s Mariana Trench. And in 1999, Piccard completed the first non-stop, around-the-world balloon flight. This feat, plus an environmentally conscious approach to innovation, spurred the renowned Swiss adventurer to dream of circumnavigating the globe in a plane that uses no fuel. The result is the Solar Impulse 2, an aircraft equipped with more than 17,000 solar cells. Thanks to lithium batteries that efficiently store energy reserves, it is the first solar-powered plane that can fly through the night. "If we want to solve our pollution and energy problems," says Piccard, a psychiatrist by training, "we need to increase our energy efficiency and focus on clean technologies. Solar Impulse 2 is really a way to show that those technologies are mature."',

Reporter:\n- ---- \nDietician:\n- True. In addition to fewer calories and saturated fats than regular hamburgers, this blend is also a greener alternative to meat since mushrooms are more sustainable than beef. \nReporter:\n- That makes sense as they require fewer resources than livestock to produce.',

(II) A 2003 study at the University of Regensburg in Germany found that 99.5 percent of dandelion seeds land within 10 metres of their plant.

(IV) So, that gives each seed just one second of flight time to be blown sideways by the wind to its new home.
